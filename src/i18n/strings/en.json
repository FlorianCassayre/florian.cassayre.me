  "home.publications.lisaFrontMscThesis.shortAbstract": "We propose a front-end framework for the novel proof assistant LISA. The two systems are based on Gentzen's sequent calculus with first-order logic and are implemented in the Scala programming language. Our framework supports different proof styles and provides a declarative language for tactics. The usage of tactics is facilitated thanks to a parameter inference system. The proofs written in our framework can be translated into the trusted kernel for verification. We demonstrate that our framework simplifies the process of writing formal proofs for LISA, and that it is suitable for an interactive usage. We also introduce other relevant components for LISA such as a strongly typed programming interface, a two-way parser and printer, and a proof simplifier.",
